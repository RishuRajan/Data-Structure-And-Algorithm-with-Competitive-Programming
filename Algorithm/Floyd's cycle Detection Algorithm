//ONE OF THE BASIC IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS ALGORITHM
//FINDING THE REPEATED VALUE IN A GIVEN ARRAY IN WITH TIME COMPLEXITY O(N) AND SPACE COMPLEXITY O(1)
//THIS ALGORITHM IS ALSO KNOWN AS TORTOISE AND HARE'S ALGORITHM
SOURCE CODE-
//FUNCTION TO PRINT ALL DUPLICATE ELEMENT PRESENT IN GIVEN ARRAY
//Basic idea is that if duplicates present in given array then there must atleast two collisions of slow and fast
class solution{
    public:
          int findduplicate(vector<int>& nums)
