//PROBLEM STATEMENT-
Given an array, print the Next Greater Element (NGE) for every element. The Next greater Element for an element x is the first greater element on the right side of x in array. Elements for which no greater element exist, consider next greater element as -1.

For the input array [4, 5, 2, 25}, the next greater elements for each element are as follows.

Element --> NGE

4 --> 5

5 --> 25

2 --> 25

25 --> -1

For the input array [13, 7, 6, 12}, the next greater elements for each element are as follows.

Element --> NGE

13 --> -1

7 --> 12

6 --> 12

12 --> -1

Input Format

The first line of input contains an integer n denoting the size of the array

The next line contains n space seperated array elements in integer range

0 < n < = 65535

Output Format

Output consists of n lines

Each line should contain 2 space seperated integers

The first integer should represent the array element and second integer should represent the next greater element

Sample Input

4

4 5 2 25

Sample Output

4 5

5 25

2 25

25 -1
